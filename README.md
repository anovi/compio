# Compio

A tiny notebook editor for everyday math. Type calculations line by line; results appear at the end of each line as you go.

## About

Compio is a document-style calculator: each line is either a computed expression or a named value you can reuse below. It is meant for budgets, unit conversions, quick what-if math, and notes that stay live as you edit.

```text
monthly = 4200 EUR
rent = 1450 EUR
left = monthly - rent          → 2750 EUR

10 km in mi                    → 6.21 mi
freelance_usd = 800 USD
freelance_eur = freelance_usd in EUR
```

**What you can do**

- Write arithmetic with familiar operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `%`, `^`) and parentheses
- Name results with `name = expression` and refer to them on later lines
- Use built-in functions (`sqrt`, `root`, `round`, `sum`, `average`, and more)
- Attach units to numbers and convert with `in`, `to`, or `as` (e.g. `10 USD in EUR`, `250 g in kg`)
- Mix compatible units in addition and subtraction (e.g. `10 cm + 1 m`)
- Add comments (`//`) and headings (`#`) that the calculator ignores
- Work with multiple documents, light/dark theme, and install as a PWA on supported browsers

For syntax details and examples, see the [user manual](docs/user-manual.md).

## Development

Compio is an npm workspace monorepo:

- `apps/pwa` owns the shipped application, document workflows, templates, theme persistence, install UI, and PWA configuration.
- `packages/calculator` owns calculation, language/parser, units, currency metadata, and exchange-rate state.
- `packages/web-ui` owns generic DOM components, shared icons, and device detection.
- `packages/editor` owns reusable CodeMirror behavior and editor-only browser utilities.

Install all workspaces with `npm ci`. Run `npm run dev` to watch the three library packages and start the PWA development server. Applications always consume the compiled `@compio/*` package exports from `dist`; source-path aliases and imports into another workspace's `src` directory are intentionally prohibited.

Production builds run in a fixed dependency order: calculator, web UI, editor, then PWA. The root `npm run build`, `npm run typecheck`, `npm run lint`, and `npm test` commands cover every workspace. The generated Lezer parser remains tracked source; regenerate it explicitly with `npm run grammar`.

## Precision and decimals

Compio computes with full precision behind the scenes. What you see in the **result pill** at the end of each line is a rounded, human-friendly display — not the raw internal value.

**How results are shown**

- Large whole numbers are grouped with spaces: `1 222 323.23`
- **Plain numbers** (no unit) are rounded to **6 decimal places**
- **Currencies** are rounded to their usual minor units — typically 2 places (e.g. `92.35 USD`, `11 EUR`), sometimes 3 for currencies like BHD
- **Physical units** (length, mass, temperature, time, and so on) use precision that fits the kind of quantity — for example, temperatures to about `0.01°`, lengths to about `0.0001` at everyday scales
- As a value gets **larger**, fewer digits are shown after the decimal point so the pill stays readable (`1 234.57 km` rather than a long tail of decimals)
- Very **small** converted values are kept with enough digits that they do not round away to zero (`0.0002 min` stays visible)
- Extremely **large** or **tiny** numbers may appear in **scientific notation** (e.g. `1.23e-7`) when a normal decimal string would be unwieldy

**More detail on hover**

On desktop, hover a result pill to see a tooltip with a **more precise** value (up to 15 decimal places) and the **full unit name** when applicable. On mobile, tap the pill to open the same detail.

## Install as an app

Compio is a [Progressive Web App](https://web.dev/explore/progressive-web-apps). You can install it on your phone or computer and open it from the home screen or app launcher — like a native app, without the browser toolbar.

**What you get**

- A standalone window focused on your documents
- Documents saved locally in the browser
- The app shell works offline; previously fetched exchange rates are cached too

**How to install**

On **desktop** (Chrome, Edge, and similar):

1. Open Compio in the browser.
2. Click **Install as app** in the bottom-right corner, or open the app menu and choose **Install the app**.

You may also see an install icon in the address bar. The in-app link appears only when the browser offers install and the app is not already installed.

On **desktop** (Safari):

1. Open Compio in the browser.
2. Tap the **Share** button.
3. Choose **Add to Dock**.

On **Android** (Chrome and other Chromium browsers):

1. Open Compio in the browser.
2. Tap **Install as app** in the bottom-right corner, or open the app menu and choose **Install the app**.

On **iPhone and iPad** (Safari, Chrome, or any browser):

1. Open Compio in the browser.
2. Tap the **Share** button.
3. Choose **Add to Home Screen**.


After installation, updates are applied automatically in the background when you use the app.

## Limitations

**Currency signs are not supported.** Use ISO 4217 codes instead of symbols:

| Not supported | Use instead |
|---------------|-------------|
| `$100`        | `100 USD`   |
| `€50`         | `50 EUR`    |
| `£20`         | `20 GBP`    |

Currency conversion between codes (e.g. `10 USD in EUR`) requires a network connection; rates come from the [Frankfurter](https://www.frankfurter.app/) API. But once used exchange rates are cached, it can work offline, though the rates will be outdated.

Other limitations:

- One expression or one binding per line
- You cannot convert between unrelated kinds (e.g. `222 m in USD` → `NaN`)
- Multiplying or dividing incompatible units (e.g. `10 cm * 2 EUR`) yields `NaN`
- String literals (`"hello"`) and date literals (`2026-05-30`) are recognized by the editor but not evaluated as numbers

## Current issues

- **Compound units from multiplication** — Multiplying two lengths does not produce area units (`4.2 m * 3.6 m` keeps `m`, not `m2`). Converting derived quantities like `room_area in ft2` is not supported yet.
- **Ambiguous unit spellings** — Some inputs match more than one unit (e.g. `MS` can mean megaseconds or milliseconds). Compio reports an ambiguity error; use the exact spelling you mean (`Ms` vs `ms`).
- **Exchange rates when offline** — Currency conversions show `NaN` until rates are fetched. Exotic or unsupported pairs may stay unavailable depending on Frankfurter coverage.
